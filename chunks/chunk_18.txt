6. Fees and Taxes 
We charge sellers for the use of our Services. In some cases, where buyers receive supplemental 
Services such as authentication or storage Services for items in certain categories, we may also 
charge those buyers for such supplemental Services. 
The fees we charge sellers for using our Services to sell goods and services are listed on our Selling 
fees pages. We may change our selling fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay 
site fourteen (14) days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or 
any changes that result in the reduction of fees.

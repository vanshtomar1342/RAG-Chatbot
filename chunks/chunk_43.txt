3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be 
permitted to return the item if the item isâ€¯eligible for return. 
In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned 
to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an 
eBay-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use 
an eBay-generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the 
shipping label from the refund owed to you.

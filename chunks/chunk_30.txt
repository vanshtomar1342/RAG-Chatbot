One of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through the eBay 
International Shipping Program ("EIS"). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel processing, international 
shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service 
providers that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program. By listing your item on 
eBay.com you agree to the EIS Terms and Conditions. If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can 
opt out of the program by updating your shipping preferences.

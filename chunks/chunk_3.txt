Disputes" provisions below). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate which will, with limited 
exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or related third parties to binding and 
final arbitration, unless you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate in accordance with section 19.B.9 
(see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")). If you do not opt out: (1) you will only be 
permitted to pursue claims against us or related third parties on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff 
or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding; (2) you will only be permitted to 
seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis; and (3) you 
are waiving your right to pursue disputes or claims and seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury 
trial.

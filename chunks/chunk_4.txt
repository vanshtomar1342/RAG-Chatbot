2. About eBay 
eBay is a marketplace that allows users to offer, sell, and buy goods and services in various 
geographic locations using a variety of pricing formats. eBay is not a party to contracts for sale 
between third-party sellers and buyers, nor is eBay a traditional auctioneer. 
Any guidance eBay provides as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is 
solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. We may use artificial intelligence or AI-
powered tools and products to provide and improve our Services, to offer you a customized and 
personalized experience, to provide you with enhanced customer service, and to support fraud 
detection; availability and accuracy of these tools are not guaranteed. We may help facilitate the 
resolution of disputes between buyers and sellers through various programs. Unless otherwise

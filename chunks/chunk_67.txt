Notice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute 
through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration & 
Mediation ("NAM") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules 
and Procedure (the "NAM Comprehensive Rules") in effect at the time of arbitration, except 
as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration 
Filings (the "NAM Mass Filing Rules"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the 
"NAM Rules"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently 
available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If NAM is unavailable to 
administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the 
parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the 
administrator.

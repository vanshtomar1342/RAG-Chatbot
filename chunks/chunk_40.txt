14. Additional Terms 
Returns and cancellations for sellers 
Sellers can create rules to automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances. 
For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates 
the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account 
settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns 
or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree 
to comply with our returns policy. 
When an item is returned or if a transaction is canceled after payment has been completed, eBay 
may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller's behalf and charge the seller for the amount of the 
refund.

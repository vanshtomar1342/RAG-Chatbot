instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, 
an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court 
can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a 
court would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, 
without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to 
Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to 
Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding 
Section 19.B.3 ("Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief") including any claim 
that all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section 
has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an 
arbitrator.
